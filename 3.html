  <P>
  Too alarmin' now to talk about
  Take your pictures down and shake it out
  Truth or consequence, say it aloud
  Use that evidence, race it around
  There goes Has someone taken your faith
  Watch him as he goes
  There goes my hero
  He's ordinary
  Don't the best of them bleed it out
  While the rest of them peter out?
  Truth or consequence, say it aloud
  Use that evidence, race it around
  There goes my hero
  Watch him as he goes
  There goes my hero
  He's ordinary
  Kudos, my hero, leavin' all the best
  You know my hero, the one that's on
  There goes my hero
  Watch him as he goes
  There goes my hero
  He's ordinary</p>
